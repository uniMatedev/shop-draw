      explore among the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came
      just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period
      of the day the sunâ€™s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the
      silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided
      it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep.
